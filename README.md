# Discord_bot

Just a very basic discord bot that I've made to learn how to use the discord.js library. It's not very useful, I've just made it to learn how to use the library. (The bot is strongly inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Hgp6bg0kI&list=PL_cUvD4qzbkwA7WITceoc2_FFjQsBkwX7&index=1))
